[![Go reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/cespedes/svn)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/cespedes/svn)

This package provides client and server implementations of the
[SVN protocol](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/subversion/libsvn_ra_svn/protocol)
in Go.

This is a work in progress, and it is in a very early stage:
do not expect this package to be working yet.
